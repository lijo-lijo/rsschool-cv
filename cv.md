### About me
I'm third year student of BSUIR. In the 4th semester we have subject called Program Interface Development. By the way, teachers were from EPAM. We make our own website in these classes. And i found it very interesting, because you do something and you instantly see what changed in your project. That's the reason why I'm here. 

I hope my interest in the Frontend, responsibility and the desire to gain new knowledge will help me graduate from this school!
